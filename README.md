#  Sample Analytical Queries

## 1️ Most Prescribed Medicine

```sql
SELECT MedicineID,
       COUNT(MedicineID) AS Mostly_Prescribed
FROM prescriptions
GROUP BY MedicineID
ORDER BY COUNT(MedicineID) DESC;
```

---

## 2️ Department-wise Doctor Count

```sql
SELECT d.DepartmentName,
       COUNT(doc.DoctorID) AS TotalDoctors
FROM departments d
JOIN doctors doc
ON d.DepartmentID = doc.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.DepartmentName;
```

---

## 3️ Total Hospital Revenue

```sql
SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalRevenue
FROM bills;
```

---

## 4️ Patients with More Than 3 Lab Tests

```sql
SELECT p.PatientName,
       COUNT(l.LabTestID) AS TotalTests
FROM patients p
JOIN labtests l
ON p.PatientID = l.PatientID
GROUP BY p.PatientName
HAVING COUNT(l.LabTestID) > 3;
```
